#Ideas for ridiculous question thing
#if you took the L of water in an adult human body, how many camp fires could one person put out?

#50-65% water
#one campfire takes about 3 gallons to extinguish
#weight of a person in kg will account of L of water


def personwater():
	weight = random.randrange(45, 100):
	waterper = random.randrange(5500, 6500)/10000
	waterkg = weight*waterper
